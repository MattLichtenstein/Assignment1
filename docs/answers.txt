	Advantages of branching: 
		- Allows you to create a reliable, separate environment in the repository utilizing the existing codebase. Good for things like testing.
		- Branching is good for organization when several people are working on the same project, and maybe adding different implementations of a feature, easy to compare side-by-side which feature you like the best without commiting over somebodys code and tracking revisions.

	The difference between git status and git log are that git status shows you things like untracked files in your working directory and updated, but uncommited files. Git log shows a list of commits in chronological order of when they were commited, providing information such as commit ID, author, and a commit message
