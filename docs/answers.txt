	Advantages of branching: 
		- Allows you to create a reliable, separate environment in the repository utilizing the existing codebase. Good for things like testing.
		- Branching is good for organization when several people are working on the same project, and maybe adding different implementations of a feature, easy to compare side-by-side which feature you like the best without commiting over somebodys code and tracking revisions.

	The difference between git status and git log are that git status shows you things like untracked files in your working directory and updated, but uncommited files. Git log shows a list of commits in chronological order of when they were commited, providing information such as commit ID, author, and a commit message

	git log Weapon.h

	git log --all --grep='file'

	i) In object-oriented programming, inheritance is when all objects of a class are derived from another class and acquire their properties such as methods and member data
	ii) Polymorphism is the use of abstract programming where each object has its own implementation, meaning a variable can technically be of one or more types. This works when a dervied class references a base or parent class and can potentially be referring to different things
	iii) Encapsulation is combining functions and member data into something like a class where you cannot manipulate the data directly, but mainly through the functions of the class. It can be thought of as a way to 'hide' data

7) This RoleGame prototype is using encapsulation because it contains classes that are their to combine data with functions. This game is also using polymorphism because their is abstraction with weapons in that a weapon can have multiple different forms or meanings.
